Hey! So I really tried using Replit for my app Stimuli, but honestly... I’m just not feeling the UI.

It’s way too plain, kinda clunky, and doesn't give me the vibe I’m going for. I want tabbed navigation (like Games, Progress, Achievements, Journal, etc.) and a design that actually feels motivational and alive, not just "hello world" and plain white.

I need animated UI elements that reflect user engagement — for example:

A tree that grows with more XP 🌱→🌳

Flowers bloom as part of the user's streak

Tabs that feel like an actual app, not just a static webpage

Something more ✨interactive✨ and friendly for neurodivergent users

I want bubbly fonts, light/black & white color options, emojis, XP bars, and badges.

TLDR: I want Replit to look like a modern web app, not a blank Google Doc with code.
