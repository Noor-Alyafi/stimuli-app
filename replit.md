## Recent Changes (January 17, 2025)

### Tree Design Finalization
- **Implemented "Cute" Tree Style Only**: User selected the cute cartoon tree design and requested removal of all other options
- **Fixed Flower Positioning**: Flowers now properly positioned ON tree branches instead of floating in air
- **Unified Tree Design**: All trees (Growth Tree, Garden trees, store buttons) now use the same cute cartoon style
- **Removed Tree Style Options**: Deleted CartoonTreeExamples component and style comparison interface per user request
- **Enhanced Growth Tree**: Main tree on Home page now uses cute design with proper sizing (not "green gumball" appearance)

### Gardening System Improvements  
- **Watering Mechanics**: Trees require watering every 2 days or they start dying
- **Health Indicators**: Visual status (Healthy ðŸ’š, Thirsty ðŸ’›, Dying ðŸ’”, Ready for First Watering ðŸ’§)
- **Achievement System**: Added gardening-specific achievements (First Sprout, Green Thumb, Forest Keeper, Caring Gardener)
- **Tree Growth Stages**: 5-stage progression with proper visual evolution and flower placement
